      Microsoft,[2][35] the third CEO in the company's history, following Bill
      Gates and Steve Ballmer.[36] In October 2014, Nadella attended an event on
      Women in Computing and courted controversy after he made a statement that
      women should not ask for a raise and should trust the system.[37] Nadella
      was criticised for the statement and he later apologized on Twitter.[38]
      He then sent an email to Microsoft employees admitting he was "Completely
      wrong."[39] Nadella leads a live discussion on Microsoft's cloud strategy
      in 2014 in San Francisco. Nadella's tenure at Microsoft has emphasized
      working with companies and technologies with which Microsoft also
      competes, including Apple Inc.,[40] Salesforce,[41] IBM,[42] and
      Dropbox.[43] In contrast to previous Microsoft campaigns against the Linux
      operating system, Nadella proclaimed that "Microsoft ❤️ Linux",[44] and
      Microsoft joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member in 2016.[45]
      Under Nadella, Microsoft revised its mission statement to "empower every
      person and every organization on the planet to achieve more".[46] He
      orchestrated a cultural shift at Microsoft by emphasizing empathy,
      collaboration, and 'growth mindset'.[47][48] He has transformed
      Microsoft's corporate culture into one that emphasizes continual learning
      and growth.[49] In 2014, Nadella's first acquisition with Microsoft was of

      for $2.5 billion. He followed that by purchasing Xamarin for an
      undisclosed amount.[50] He oversaw the purchase of professional network
      LinkedIn[51] in 2016 for $26.2 billion.[52] On 26 October 2018, Microsoft

      stock had increased nearly tenfold since Nadella became CEO in 2014, with
