    <h1>Elon Musk</h1>
    <p>
      Elon Reeve Musk (/ˈiːlɒn/; born June 28, 1971) is a businessman and
      investor. He is best known for his key roles in space company SpaceX and
      automotive company Tesla, Inc. Other notable involvements include
      ownership of X Corp., formerly Twitter, and his role in the founding of
      The Boring Company, xAI, Neuralink and OpenAI. He is one of the wealthiest
      people in the world; as of June 2024, Forbes estimates his net worth to be
      US$210 billion.[4] A member of the wealthy South African Musk family, Musk
      was born in Pretoria and briefly attended the University of Pretoria
      before immigrating to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his
      Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's
      University at Kingston in Canada. Musk later transferred to the University
      of Pennsylvania and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics.
      He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University, but dropped
      out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded online city
      guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307
      million in 1999. That same year, Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank.
      X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. In October 2002, eBay
      acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion. Using $100 million of the money he made
      from the sale of PayPal, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services
      company, in 2002. In 2004, Musk became an early investor in electric
      vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (later Tesla, Inc.). He became the
      company's chairman and product architect, assuming the position of CEO in
      2008. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar-energy company that
      was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he
      proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015,
      he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research
      company. The following year, Musk co-founded Neuralink—a neurotechnology
      company developing brain–computer interfaces—and the Boring Company, a
      tunnel construction company. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
      Commission (SEC) sued Musk, alleging that he had falsely announced that he
      had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. To settle the case,
      Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine. In
      2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion. He subsequently merged the
      company into newly created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the
      following year. In March 2023, Musk founded xAI, an artificial
      intelligence company. Musk has expressed views that have made him a
      polarizing figure.[5] He has been criticized for making unscientific and
      misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation and antisemitic
      conspiracy theories.[5][6][7][8] His ownership of Twitter has been
      similarly controversial, being marked by layoffs of large numbers of
      employees, an increase in hate speech, misinformation and disinformation
      on the website, and changes to Twitter Blue verification.

    <h2>Early life and education</h2>
    <p>
      Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa's
      administrative capital.[9][10] He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch
      ancestry.[11][12] His mother, Maye Musk (née Haldeman), is a model and
      dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South
      Africa.[13][14][15] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African
      electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, emerald dealer, and
      property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at the Timbavati
      Private Nature Reserve.[16][17][18][19] Elon has a younger brother,
      Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.[15][20] The family was wealthy during
      Elon's youth.[19] Despite both Musk and Errol previously stating that
      Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine,[19] in 2023, Errol
      recounted that the deal he made was to receive "a portion of the emeralds
      produced at three small mines."[21][22] Errol was elected to the Pretoria
      City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party
      and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of
      apartheid.[9] Elon's maternal grandfather, Joshua N. Haldeman, was an
      American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to
      Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane.[23][24][25][26]
      After his parents divorced in 1980, Elon chose to live primarily with his
      father.[11][16] Elon later regretted his decision and became estranged
      from his father.[27] In one incident, after having called a boy whose
      father had committed suicide "stupid", Elon was thrown down concrete steps
      and beaten severely by the boy and his friends, leading to him being
      hospitalized for his injuries.[28][29] Elon has four paternal
      half-siblings.[30][23][31] Elon was an enthusiastic reader of books, later
      attributing his success in part to having read The Lord of the Rings, the
      Foundation series, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.[18][32] At
      age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching
      himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual.[33] At age twelve,
      Elon sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology
      magazine for approximately $500.[34][35]
    </p>
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>
      Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School,
      and then Pretoria Boys High School, where he graduated.[36] Musk was a
      good but not exceptional student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a B on his
      senior math certification.[37] Musk applied for a Canadian passport
      through his Canadian-born mother,[38][39] knowing that it would be easier
      to immigrate to the United States this way.[40] While waiting for his
      application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for
      five months.[41] Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, connected with a
      second cousin in Saskatchewan,[42] and worked odd jobs including at a farm
      and a lumber mill.[43] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston,
      Ontario.[44][45] Two years later, he transferred to the University of
      Pennsylvania, an Ivy League university in Philadelphia, where he earned
      two degrees, a Bachelor of Arts in physics, and a Bachelor of Science
      degree in economics from the university's Wharton School.[46][47][48][49]
      Although Musk has said that he earned the degrees in 1995, the University
      of Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997.[50][47][51] He reportedly
      hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a
      business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google
      Books.[52] In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at
      energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated
      electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo
      Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.[53][54] In 1995, he was accepted
      to a graduate program in materials science at Stanford University, but did
      not enroll.[47][51] Musk decided to join the Internet boom, applying for a
      job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.[55][38]
    </p>
    <h3>Business career</h3>
    <p>
      n 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Global Link
      Information Network, later renamed to Zip2.[56][57] The company was
      started with $28,000 (equivalent to $56,000 in 2023) from Errol Musk.[33]
      The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and
      yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.[58] They worked at a small
      rented office in Palo Alto,[59] with Musk coding the website every
      night.[59] Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and
      the Chicago Tribune.[52] The brothers persuaded the board of directors to
      abandon a merger with CitySearch;[60] however, Musk's attempts to become
      CEO were thwarted.[61] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in
      February 1999,[62][63] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent
      share.[64
    </p>
    <h3>X.com and PayPal</h3>
    <p>
      In March 1999,[65] Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and
      e-mail payment company with $12 million of the money he made from the
      Compaq acquisition.[66] X.com was one of the first federally insured
      online banks, and over 200,000 customers joined in its initial months of
      operation.[67] Musk's friends expressed skepticism about the naming of the
      online bank, fearing it might have been mistaken for a pornographic site.
      Musk brushed off their concerns, emphasizing that the name was meant to be
      straightforward, memorable, and easy to type. Additionally, he was fond of
      the email configuration derived from it, such as "e@x.com".[65] Even
      though Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced
      and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[68]
      In 2000, X.com merged with the online bank Confinity to avoid
      competition,[59][68][69] as the latter's money-transfer service PayPal was
      more popular than X.com's service.[70] Musk then returned as CEO of the
      merged company. His preference for Microsoft over Unix-based software
      caused a rift among the company's employees, and eventually led Confinity
      co-founder Peter Thiel to resign.[71] With the company suffering from
      compounding technological issues and the lack of a cohesive business
      model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September
      2000.[72][b] Under Thiel, the company focused on the money-transfer
      service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[74][75] In 2002, PayPal was
      acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—PayPal's largest
      shareholder with 11.72% of shares—received $175.8 million.[76][77] In
      2017, more than 15 years later, Musk purchased the X.com domain from
      PayPal for its "sentimental value".[78][79] In 2022, Musk discussed a goal
      of creating "X, the everything app".[80]

    <h3>SpaceX</h3>
    <p>
      In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and
      discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[81]
      In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and
      Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)
      that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with the
      companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a
      novice[82] and the group returned to the United States empty-handed. In
      February 2002, the group returned to Russia with Mike Griffin (president
      of In-Q-Tel) to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with
      Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected.
      He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable
      rockets.[82] With $100 million of his own money,[83] Musk founded SpaceX
      in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer.[84][85]
      SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.[86]
      Though the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial
      Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA Administrator
      (and former SpaceX consultant[87]) Mike Griffin later that year.[88][89]
      After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies
      to go bankrupt,[86] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit
      in 2008.[90] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial
      Resupply Services contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket
      and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the
      Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[91] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle
      docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft.[92]

    <h3>Tesla</h3>
    <p>
      originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard
      and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of
      funding. Both men played active roles in the company's early development
      prior to Musk's involvement.[118] Musk led the Series A round of
      investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority
      shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[119] Musk
      took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product
      design, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business
      operations.[120] Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and
      the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Eberhard was ousted from the
      firm.[121][page needed][122] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO
      and product architect in 2008.[123] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with
      Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and
      two others.[124][125] As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any
      automotive manufacturer globally.[126] In 2021, Musk nominally changed his
      title to "Technoking" while retaining his position as CEO.[127]

    <h3>SEC and shareholder lawsuits regarding tweets</h3>
    <p>
      Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity,
      which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006.[165] By 2013,
      SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the
      United States.[166] In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building
      an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of
      the largest solar plant in the United States.[167] Construction of the
      factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint
      venture with Panasonic until early 2020.[168][169] Tesla acquired
      SolarCity for over $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit
      to create Tesla Energy. The deal's announcement resulted in a more than
      10% drop in Tesla's stock price. At the time, SolarCity was facing
      liquidity issues.[170] Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against
      Musk and Tesla's directors, stating that the purchase of SolarCity was
      done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its
      shareholders.[171][172] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January
      2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant.[173][174] Two years
      later, the court ruled in Musk's favor.[175]
    </p>
    <h3>Neuralink</h3>
    <p>
      In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company,
      with an investment of $100 million.[176][177] Neuralink aims to integrate
      the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that
      are embedded in the brain to facilitate its merging with machines. Such
      technology could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with
      software.[177][178] The company also hopes to develop devices with which
      to treat neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia,
      and spinal cord injuries.[179] In 2019, Musk announced work on a device
      akin to a sewing machine that could embed threads into a human brain.[176]
      He is listed as the sole author of an October 2019 paper that details some
      of Neuralink's research,[180] although Musk's being listed as such rankled
      the Neuralink team's researchers.[181] At a 2020 live demonstration, Musk
      described one of their early devices as "a Fitbit in your skull" that
      could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities.
      Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these
      claims,[182][183][184] with MIT Technology Review describing them as
      "highly speculative" and "neuroscience theater".[182] During the
      demonstration, Musk revealed a pig with a Neuralink implant that tracked
      neural activity related to smell.[179] In 2022, Neuralink announced that
      clinical trials would begin by the end of the year.[185] Neuralink has
      conducted further animal testing on macaque monkeys at the University of
      California, Davis' Primate Research Center. In 2021, the company released
      a video in which a Macaque played the video game Pong via a Neuralink
      implant. The company's animal trials—which have caused the deaths of some
      monkeys—have led to claims of animal cruelty. The Physicians Committee for
      Responsible Medicine has alleged that Neuralink's animal trials have
      violated the Animal Welfare Act.[186] Employees have complained that
      pressure from Musk to accelerate development has led to botched
      experiments and unnecessary animal deaths. In 2022, a federal probe was
      launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink.[187] In
      September 2023, the company was approved to intitiate human trials; the
      company will conduct a six-year study.[18
    </p>
    <h3>The Boring Company</h3>
    <p>
      In 2017, Musk founded the Boring Company to construct tunnels, and
      revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that
      could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) and thus circumvent
      above-ground traffic in major cities.[189][190] Early in 2017, the company
      began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a
      30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep "test
      trench" on the premises of SpaceX's offices, as that required no
      permits.[191] The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles (3.2 km) in
      length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model Xs and was
      reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds.[192] Two
      tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have
      been canceled.[193][194] However, a tunnel beneath the Las Vegas
      Convention Center was completed in early 2021.[195] Local officials have
      approved further expansions of the tunnel system.[196] In 2021, tunnel
      construction was approved for Fort Lauderdale, Florida.[197]
    </p>
    <h3>Twitter / X</h3>
    <p>
      Musk expressed interest in buying Twitter as early as 2017,[199] and had
      questioned the platform's commitment to freedom of speech.[200][201]
      Additionally, his ex-wife Talulah Riley had urged him to buy Twitter to
      stop the "woke-ism".[202] In January 2022, Musk started purchasing Twitter
      shares, reaching a 9.2% stake by April,[203] making him the largest
      shareholder.[204][e] When this was publicly disclosed, Twitter shares
      experienced the largest intraday price surge since the company's 2013
      IPO.[206] On April 4, Musk agreed to a deal that would appoint him to
      Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than
      14.9% of the company.[207][208] However, on April 13, Musk made a $43
      billion offer to buy Twitter, launching a takeover bid to buy 100% of
      Twitter's stock at $54.20 per share.[204][209] In response, Twitter's
      board adopted a "poison pill" shareholder rights plan to make it more
      expensive for any single investor to own more than 15% of the company
      without board approval.[210] Nevertheless, by the end of the month Musk
      had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44 billion.[211]
      This included about $12.5 billion in loans against his Tesla stock and $21
      billion in equity financing.[212][213] Tesla's stock market value sank by
      over $100 billion the next day in reaction to the deal.[214][215] He
      subsequently tweeted criticism of Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde's
      policies to his 86 million followers, which led to some of them engaging
      in sexist and racist harassment against her.[216] Exactly a month after
      announcing the takeover, Musk stated that the deal was "on hold" following
      a report that 5% of Twitter's daily active users were spam accounts.[217]
      Although he initially affirmed his commitment to the acquisition,[218] he
      sent notification of his termination of the deal in July; Twitter's Board
      of Directors responded that they were committed to holding him to the
      transaction.[219] On July 12, 2022, Twitter formally sued Musk in the
      Chancery Court of Delaware for breaching a legally binding agreement to
      purchase Twitter.[220] In October 2022, Musk reversed again, offering to
      purchase Twitter at $54.20 per share.[221] The acquisition was officially
      completed on October 27.[222] Immediately after the acquisition, Musk
      fired several top Twitter executives including CEO Parag
      Agrawal;[222][223] Musk became the CEO instead.[224] He instituted a $7.99
      monthly subscription for a "blue check",[225][226][227] and laid off a
      significant portion of the company's staff.[228][229] Musk lessened
      content moderation, including reinstating accounts like The Babylon
      Bee,[230][231] and in December, Musk released internal documents relating
      to Twitter's moderation of Hunter Biden's laptop controversy in the leadup
      to the 2020 presidential election.[232] Comments on these internal
      documents by journalists, Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss, Michael Shellenberger
      and others were posted at Twitter as the Twitter Files. The United States
      House Committee on the Judiciary held hearings on the Twitter Files on
      March 9, 2023, at which Taibbi and Shellenberger gave testimony.[233] The
      Southern Poverty Law Center noted that Twitter has verified numerous
      extremists;[234] hate speech also increased on the platform after his
      takeover.[235][236] In late 2022, Musk promised to step down as CEO after
      a Twitter poll posted by Musk found that majority of user wanted him to do
      so.[237][238] Five months later, Musk stepped down from CEO and placed
      former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino in the position and
      transitioned his role to executive chairman and chief technology
      officer.[239] On November 20, 2023, in a U.S. District Court in Texas, X
      filed a lawsuit stating that Media Matters "manipulated" the X platform. X
      stated that Media Matters used accounts that followed accounts for major
      brands, and "resorted to endlessly scrolling and refreshing" the feed
      until it found ads next to extremist posts.[240]
