    <h1>Mark Zuckerberg</h1>
    <p>
      Mark Elliot Zuckerberg (/ˈzʌkərbɜːrɡ/; born May 14, 1984) is an American
      businessman. He co-founded the social media service Facebook, along with
      his Harvard roommates in 2004, and its parent company Meta Platforms
      (formerly Facebook, Inc.), of which he is chairman, chief executive
      officer and controlling shareholder. Zuckerberg briefly attended Harvard
      University, where he launched Facebook in February 2004 with his roommates
      Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.
      Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. In
      2008, at age 23, he became the world's youngest self-made billionaire. He
      has since used his funds to organize multiple donations, including the
      establishment of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. A film depicting
      Zuckerberg's early career, legal troubles and initial success with
      Facebook, The Social Network, was released in 2010 and won multiple
      Academy Awards. His prominence and fast rise in the technology industry
      has prompted political and legal attention. The founding of Facebook
      involved Zuckerberg in multiple lawsuits regarding the creation and
      ownership of the website as well as issues of user privacy.

    <h2>Early life and education</h2>
    <p>
      Mark Elliot Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York
      to psychiatrist Karen (née Kempner) and dentist Edward Zuckerberg.[1][2]
      He and his three sisters (Arielle, Randi, and Donna) were raised in a
      Reform Jewish household[3] in Dobbs Ferry, New York.[4] His
      great-grandparents were emigrants from Austria, Germany, and Poland.[5]
      Zuckerberg initially attended Ardsley High School before transferring to
      Phillips Exeter Academy. He was captain of the fencing team.[6][7]

    <h3>Software development</h3>
    <p>
      Zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in middle school. In
      high school, he built a program that allowed all the computers between his
      house and his father's dental office to communicate with each other.[8][9]
      During Zuckerberg's high-school years, he worked to build a music player
      called the Synapse Media Player. The device used machine learning to learn
      the user's listening habits, which was posted to Slashdot[10] and received
      a rating of 3 out of 5 from PC Magazine.[11] The New Yorker once said of
      Zuckerberg: "some kids played computer games. Mark created them."[4] While
      still in high school, he attended Mercy College taking a graduate computer
      course on Thursday evenings.[4]

    <h4>College years</h4>
    <p>
      The New Yorker noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at Harvard
      in 2002, he had already achieved a "reputation as a programming
      prodigy".[4] He studied psychology and computer science,[12] resided in
      Kirkland House,[13] and belonged to Alpha Epsilon Pi.[4] In his second
      year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users
      to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students
      and help them form study groups.[14] Later, he created a different program
      he initially called Facemash that let students select the best-looking
      person from a choice of photos. Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at the
      time, explained:

    <h4>Facebook</h4>
    <p>
      In January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website.[18] On
      February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched "Thefacebook", originally located at
      thefacebook.com, in partnership with his roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew
      McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.[19][20] An earlier
      inspiration for Facebook may have come from Phillips Exeter Academy, the
      prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in 2002. It published its own
      student directory, "The Photo Address Book", which students referred to as
      "The Facebook". Such photo directories were an important part of the
      student social experience at many private schools. With them, students
      were able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends, and
      their telephone numbers.[20]

    <h3>Other projects</h3>
    <p>
      A month after Zuckerberg launched Facebook in February 2004, i2hub,
      another campus-only service, created by Wayne Chang and focusing on
      peer-to-peer file sharing, was launched. At the time, both i2hub and
      Facebook were gaining the attention of the press and growing rapidly in
      users and publicity. In August 2004, Zuckerberg, Andrew McCollum, Adam
      D'Angelo, and Sean Parker launched a competing peer-to-peer file sharing
      service called Wirehog, a precursor to Facebook Platform applications,
      which was launched in 2007.[64][65][66] In 2013, Zuckerberg launched
      Internet.org, which he described as an initiative to provide Internet
      access to the five billion people without it as of the launch date. The
      project faced significant opposition in India, where activists said its
      limited internet ran counter to the principle of net neutrality;
      Zuckerberg responded by saying that a limited internet was better than no
      internet. Internet.org was shut down in India in February 2016, although
      Zuckerberg later met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss
      further possibilities.[67][68] Zuckerberg is a board member of the solar
      sail spacecraft development project Breakthrough Starshot, which he
      co-founded with Yuri Milner and Stephen Hawking in 2016.[69]

    <h3>Controversies and lawsuits</h3>
    <p>
      ConnectU lawsuits Main article: ConnectU Harvard students Cameron
      Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra accused Zuckerberg of
      intentionally making them believe he would help them build a social
      network called HarvardConnection.com (later called ConnectU).[70] They
      filed a lawsuit in 2004; it was dismissed on a technicality on March 28,
      2007. It was refiled soon thereafter in a federal court in Boston.
      Facebook countersued in regards to Social Butterfly, a project put out by
      The Winklevoss Chang Group, an alleged partnership between ConnectU and
      i2hub. On June 25, 2008, the case settled and Facebook agreed to transfer
      over 1.2 million common shares and pay $20 million in cash.[71] In
      November 2007, confidential court documents were posted on the website of
      02138, a magazine that catered to Harvard alumni. They included
      Zuckerberg's Social Security number, his parents' home address, and his
      girlfriend's address. Though Facebook filed to have the documents removed,
      the judge ruled in favor of 02138.[72]

    <h3>Pakistan criminal investigation</h3>
    <p>
      n June 2010, then Pakistani Deputy Attorney General Muhammad Azhar
      Sidiqque launched a criminal investigation into Zuckerberg and Facebook
      co-founders Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes after a "Draw Muhammad"
      contest was hosted on Facebook. The investigation also named the anonymous
      German woman who created the contest. Sidiqque asked the country's police
      to contact Interpol to have Zuckerberg and the three others arrested for
      blasphemy. On May 19, 2010, Facebook's website was temporarily blocked in
      Pakistan until Facebook removed the contest from its website at the end of
      May. Sidiqque also asked its UN representative to raise the issue with the
      United Nations General Assembly.[75][76]
    </p>
    <h3>The Social Network</h3>
    <p>
      A movie based on Zuckerberg and the founding years of Facebook, The Social
      Network, was released on October 1, 2010, starring Jesse Eisenberg as
      Zuckerberg. After Zuckerberg was told about the film, he responded, "I
      just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was still alive."[93]
      Also, after the film's script was leaked on the Internet and it was
      apparent that the film would not portray Zuckerberg in a wholly positive
      light, he stated that he wanted to establish himself as a "good guy".[94]
      The film is based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich,
      which the book's publicist once described as "big juicy fun" rather than
      "reportage".[95] The film's screenwriter Aaron Sorkin told New York
      magazine, "I don't want my fidelity to be the truth; I want it to be
      storytelling", adding, "What is the big deal about accuracy purely for
      accuracy's sake, and can we not have the true be the enemy of the
      good?"[96] Upon winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture on January
      16, 2011, producer Scott Rudin thanked Facebook and Zuckerberg "for his
      willingness to allow us to use his life and work as a metaphor through
      which to tell a story about communication and the way we relate to each
      other."[97] Sorkin, who won for Best Screenplay, retracted some of the
      impressions given in his script:[98] I wanted to say to Mark Zuckerberg
      tonight, if you're watching, Rooney Mara's character makes a prediction at
      the beginning of the movie. She was wrong. You turned out to be a great
      entrepreneur, a visionary, and an incredible altruist. In January 2011,
      Zuckerberg made a surprise guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, which
      was hosted by Jesse Eisenberg. They both said it was the first time they
      had met.[99] Eisenberg asked Zuckerberg, who had been critical of his
      portrayal by the film, what he thought of the movie. Zuckerberg replied,
      "It was interesting."[100] In a subsequent interview about their meeting,
      Eisenberg explained that he was "nervous to meet him, because I had spent
      now, a year and a half thinking about him ..." He added, "Mark has been so
      gracious about something that's really so uncomfortable ... The fact that
      he would do SNL and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous.
      It's the best possible way to handle something that, I think, could
      otherwise be very uncomfortable."[101][102]

    <h4>Disputed accuracy</h4>
    <p>
      According to David Kirkpatrick, former technology editor at Fortune
      magazine and author of The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the
      Company that is Connecting the World (2011),[103] "the film is only "40%
      true ... he is not snide and sarcastic in a cruel way, the way Zuckerberg
      is played in the movie." He says that "a lot of the factual incidents are
      accurate, but many are distorted and the overall impression is false", and
      concludes that primarily "his motivations were to try and come up with a
      new way to share information on the Internet".[104] Although the film
      portrayed Zuckerberg's creation of Facebook in order to elevate his
      stature after not getting into any of the elite final clubs at Harvard,
      Zuckerberg stated that he had no interest in joining the clubs.[4]
      Kirkpatrick agreed that the impression implied by the film is "false".
      Karel Baloun, a former senior engineer at Facebook, noted that the "image
      of Zuckerberg as a socially inept nerd is overstated ... It is fiction
      ..." He likewise dismissed the film's assertion that he "would
      deliberately betray a friend."[104]
