    <h1>Mobile phone</h1>
    <p>
      A mobile phone (or cellphone[a]) is a portable telephone that can make and
      receive calls over a radio frequency link while the user is moving within
      a telephone service area, as opposed to a fixed-location phone (landline
      phone). The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching
      systems of a mobile phone operator, which provides access to the public
      switched telephone network (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone services use a
      cellular network architecture, and therefore mobile telephones are called
      cellphones (or "cell phones") in North America. In addition to telephony,
      digital mobile phones support a variety of other services, such as text
      messaging, multimedia messaging, email, Internet access (via LTE, 5G NR or
      Wi-Fi), short-range wireless communications (infrared, Bluetooth),
      satellite access (navigation, messaging connectivity), business
      applications, payments (via NFC), multimedia playback and streaming
      (radio, television), digital photography, and video games. Mobile phones
      offering only basic capabilities are known as feature phones (slang:
      "dumbphones"); mobile phones that offer greatly advanced computing
      capabilities are referred to as smartphones.[1] The first handheld mobile
      phone was demonstrated by Martin Cooper of Motorola in New York City on 3
      April 1973, using a handset weighing c. 2 kilograms (4.4 lbs).[2] In 1979,
      Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) launched the world's first cellular
      network in Japan.[3] In 1983, the DynaTAC 8000x was the first commercially
      available handheld mobile phone. From 1983 to 2014, worldwide mobile phone
      subscriptions grew to over seven billion; enough to provide one for every
      person on Earth.[4] In the first quarter of 2016, the top smartphone
      developers worldwide were Samsung, Apple and Huawei; smartphone sales
      represented 78 percent of total mobile phone sales.[5] For feature phones
      as of 2016, the top-selling brands were Samsung, Nokia and Alcatel.[6]
      Mobile phones are considered an important human invention as they have
      been one of the most widely used and sold pieces of consumer
      technology.[7] The growth in popularity has been rapid in some places, for
      example, in the UK, the total number of mobile phones overtook the number
      of houses in 1999.[8] Today, mobile phones are globally ubiquitous,[9] and
      in almost half the world's countries, over 90% of the population owns at
      least one.[10]

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      A handheld mobile radio telephone service was envisioned in the early
      stages of radio engineering. In 1917, Finnish inventor Eric Tigerstedt
      filed a patent for a "pocket-size folding telephone with a very thin
      carbon microphone". Early predecessors of cellular phones included analog
      radio communications from ships and trains. The race to create truly
      portable telephone devices began after World War II, with developments
      taking place in many countries. The advances in mobile telephony have been
      traced in successive "generations", starting with the early
      zeroth-generation (0G) services, such as Bell System's Mobile Telephone
      Service and its successor, the Improved Mobile Telephone Service. These 0G
      systems were not cellular, supported a few simultaneous calls, and were
      very expensive.

    <h3>Smartphone</h3>
    <p>
      Smartphones have a number of distinguishing features. The International
      Telecommunication Union measures those with Internet connection, which it
      calls Active Mobile-Broadband subscriptions (which includes tablets,
      etc.). In the developed world, smartphones have now overtaken the usage of
      earlier mobile systems. However, in the developing world, they account for
      around 50% of mobile telephony.

    <h4>Feature phone</h4>
    <p>
      Feature phone is a term typically used as a retronym to describe mobile
      phones which are limited in capabilities in contrast to a modern
      smartphone. Feature phones typically provide voice calling and text
      messaging functionality, in addition to basic multimedia and Internet
      capabilities, and other services offered by the user's wireless service
      provider. A feature phone has additional functions over and above a basic
      mobile phone, which is only capable of voice calling and text
      messaging.[18][19] Feature phones and basic mobile phones tend to use a
      proprietary, custom-designed software and user interface. By contrast,
      smartphones generally use a mobile operating system that often shares
      common traits across devices.

    <h5>Infrastructure</h5>
    <p>
      Main articles: Cellular network and Wi-Fi Cellular networks work by only
      reusing radio frequencies (in this example frequencies f1-f4) in non
      adjacent cells to avoid interference The critical advantage that modern
      cellular networks have over predecessor systems is the concept of
      frequency reuse allowing many simultaneous telephone conversations in a
      given service area. This allows efficient use of the limited radio
      spectrum allocated to mobile services, and lets thousands of subscribers
      converse at the same time within a given geographic area. Former systems
      would cover a service area with one or two powerful base stations with a
      range of up to tens of kilometers' (miles), using only a few sets of radio
      channels (frequencies). Once these few channels were in use by customers,
      no further customers could be served until another user vacated a channel.
      It would be impractical to give every customer a unique channel since
      there would not be enough bandwidth allocated to the mobile service. As
      well, technical limitations such as antenna efficiency and receiver design
      limit the range of frequencies a customer unit could use. A cellular
      network mobile phone system gets its name from dividing the service area
      into many small cells, each with a base station with (for example) a
      useful range on the order of a kilometer (mile). These systems have dozens
      or hundreds of possible channels allocated to them. When a subscriber is
      using a given channel for a telephone connection, that frequency is
      unavailable for other customers in the local cell and in the adjacent
      cells. However, cells further away can re-use that channel without
      interference as the subscriber's handset is too far away to be detected.
      The transmitter power of each base station is coordinated to efficiently
      service its own cell, but not to interfere with the cells further away.
      Automation embedded in the customer's handset and in the base stations
      control all phases of the call, from detecting the presence of a handset
      in a service area, temporary assignment of a channel to a handset making a
      call, interface with the land-line side of the network to connect to other
      subscribers, and collection of billing information for the service. The
      automation systems can control the "hand off" of a customer handset moving
      between one cell and another so that a call in progress continues without
      interruption, changing channels if required. In the earliest mobile phone
      systems by contrast, all control was done manually; the customer would
      search for an unoccupied channel and speak to a mobile operator to request
      connection of a call to a landline number or another mobile. At the
      termination of the call the mobile operator would manually record the
      billing information. Mobile phones communicate with cell towers that are
      placed to give coverage across a telephone service area, which is divided
      up into 'cells'. Each cell uses a different set of frequencies from
      neighboring cells, and will typically be covered by three towers placed at
      different locations. The cell towers are usually interconnected to each
      other and the phone network and the internet by wired connections. Due to
      bandwidth limitations each cell will have a maximum number of cell phones
      it can handle at once. The cells are therefore sized depending on the
      expected usage density, and may be much smaller in cities. In that case
      much lower transmitter powers are used to avoid broadcasting beyond the
      cell. In order to handle the high traffic, multiple towers can be set up
      in the same area (using different frequencies). This can be done
      permanently or temporarily such as at special events or in disasters. Cell
      phone companies will bring a truck with equipment to host the abnormally
      high traffic. Capacity was further increased when phone companies
      implemented digital networks. With digital, one frequency can host
      multiple simultaneous calls. Additionally, short-range Wi-Fi
      infrastructure is often used by smartphones as much as possible as it
      offloads traffic from cell networks on to local area networks.
