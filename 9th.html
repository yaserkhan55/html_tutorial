    <h1>Bill Gates</h1>
    <p>
      William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American
      businessman, investor, philanthropist, and writer best known for
      co-founding the software giant Microsoft, along with his childhood friend
      Paul Allen. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of
      chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president, and chief software
      architect, while also being its largest individual shareholder until May
      2014.[a] He was a pioneer of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and
      1980s. Gates was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. In 1975, he and
      Allen founded Microsoft in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Gates led the company
      as its chairman and chief executive officer until stepping down as CEO in
      January 2000, succeeded by Steve Ballmer, but he remained chairman of the
      board of directors and became chief software architect. During the late
      1990s, he was criticized for his business tactics, which were considered
      anti-competitive. In June 2008, Gates transitioned into a part-time role
      at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,
      the private charitable foundation he and his then-wife Melinda had
      established in 2000. He stepped down as chairman of the Microsoft board in
      February 2014 and assumed the role of technology adviser to support newly
      appointed CEO Satya Nadella. In March 2020, Gates left his board positions
      at Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus on his philanthropic efforts
      on climate change, global health and development, and education. Later in
      his career and since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft in 2008,
      Gates has pursued other business and philanthropic endeavors. He is the
      founder and chairman of several companies, including BEN, Cascade
      Investment, TerraPower, Gates Ventures, and Breakthrough Energy. He has
      donated sizable amounts of money to various charitable organizations and
      scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,
      reported to be the world's largest private charity. Through the
      foundation, he led an early 21st century vaccination campaign that
      significantly contributed to the eradication of the wild poliovirus in
      Africa. In 2010, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge,
      whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their
      wealth to philanthropy.

    <h2>Early life and education</h2>
    <p>
      William Henry Gates III was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle,
      Washington[3] as the only son of William H. Gates Sr.[b] (1925–2020) and
      his first wife, Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994).[4] His ancestry includes
      English, German, and Irish/Scots-Irish.[5] His father was a prominent
      lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors of First
      Interstate BancSystem and United Way of America. Gates's maternal
      grandfather was J. W. Maxwell, a national bank president. He also has an
      older sister Kristi (Kristianne) and a younger sister Libby. He is the
      fourth of his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or
      "Trey" (i.e., three) because his father had the "II" suffix.[6][7] The
      family lived in the Sand Point area of Seattle in a home that was damaged
      by a rare tornado when Gates was seven years old.[8] When Gates was young
      his parents wanted him to pursue a career in law.[9] During his childhood,
      his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian
      Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination.[10][11][12] Gates was small
      for his age and was bullied as a child.[7] The family encouraged
      competition; one visitor reported that "it didn't matter whether it was
      hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock; there was always a reward
      for winning and there was always a penalty for losing".[13] Gates (right)
      with Paul Allen seated at Teletype Model 33 ASR terminals in Lakeside
      School, 1970 At age 13, he enrolled in the private Lakeside prep
      school,[14][15] where he wrote his first software program.[16] When he was
      in eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from
      Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and
      a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the
      students.[17] Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in
      BASIC, and he was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He
      wrote his first computer program on this machine, an implementation of
      tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates
      was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software
      code perfectly.[18] After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, Gates
      and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers.
      One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation
      (CCC) which banned Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Gates's best friend
      and first business partner Kent Evans for the summer after it caught them
      exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer
      time.[19][7] The four students formed the Lakeside Programmers Club to
      make money.[7] At the end of the ban, they offered to find bugs in CCC's
      software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than using the system
      remotely via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code
      for various programs that ran on the system, including Fortran, Lisp, and
      machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970 when the
      company went out of business. The following year, a Lakeside teacher
      enlisted Gates and Evans to automate the school's class-scheduling system,
      providing them computer time and royalties in return. The duo worked
      diligently in order to have the program ready for their senior year.
      Towards the end of their junior year, Evans was killed in a mountain
      climbing accident, which Gates described as one of the saddest days of his
      life. He then turned to Allen who helped him finish the system for
      Lakeside.[7] At 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen called Traf-O-Data
      to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor.[20] In 1972,
      he served as a congressional page in the House of Representatives.[21][22]
      He was a national merit scholar when he graduated from Lakeside School in
      1973.[23] He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests
      (SAT) and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973.[24][25] He
      did not stay at Harvard long enough to choose a concentration, but took
      mathematics (including Math 55) and graduate level computer science
      courses.[26] While at Harvard, he met fellow student and future Microsoft
      CEO Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer stayed
      and graduated magna cum laude. Years later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as
      Microsoft's CEO and maintained that position from 2000 until his
      resignation in 2014.[27][28] Gates devised an algorithm for pancake
      sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems[29]
      presented in a combinatorics class by professor Harry Lewis. His solution
      held the record as the fastest version for over 30 years, and its
      successor is faster by only 2%.[29][30] His solution was formalized and
      published in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist Christos
      Papadimitriou.[31] Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen and joined
      him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974.[32] In 1975, the MITS Altair
      8800 was released based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw the
      opportunity to start their own computer software company.[33] Gates
      dropped out of Harvard that same year. His parents were supportive of him
      after seeing how much he wanted to start his own company.[34] He explained
      his decision to leave Harvard: "if things hadn't worked out, I could
      always go back to school. I was officially on leave."[

    <h3>BASIC</h3>
    <p>
      Gates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics which
      demonstrated the Altair 8800, and contacted Micro Instrumentation and
      Telemetry Systems (MITS) to inform them that he and others were working on
      a BASIC interpreter for the platform.[36] In reality, Gates and Allen did
      not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to
      gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a
      demonstration, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair
      emulator that ran on a m inicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The
      demonstration was held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it
      was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the
      interpreter as Altair BASIC. MITS hired Allen,[37] and Gates took a leave
      of absence from Harvard to work with him at MITS in November 1975. Allen
      named their partnership "Micro-Soft", a combination of "microcomputer" and
      "software", and their first office was in Albuquerque. The first employee
      Gates and Allen hired was their high school collaborator Ric Weiland.[37]
      They dropped the hyphen within a year and officially registered the trade
      name "Microsoft" with the Secretary of the State of New Mexico on November
      26, 1976.[37] Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.
      Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates
      discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked out and was being widely
      copied and distributed. In February 1976, he wrote An Open Letter to
      Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90%
      of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and
      the Altair "hobby market" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for
      any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain
      high-quality software.[38] This letter was unpopular with many computer
      hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers
      should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in
      late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for
      various systems.[37] The company moved from Albuquerque to Bellevue,
      Washington on January 1, 1979.[36] Gates said he personally reviewed and
      often rewrote every line of code that the company produced in its first
      five years. As the company grew, he transitioned into a manager role, then
      an executive.[39] DONKEY.BAS, is a computer game written in 1981 and
      included with early versions of the PC DOS operating system distributed
      with the original IBM PC. It is a driving game in which the player must
      avoid hitting donkeys. The game was written by Gates and Neil
      Konzen.[40][41]
