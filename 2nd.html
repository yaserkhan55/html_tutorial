    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Infosys was founded by seven engineers in Pune, Maharashtra, India, with
      an initial capital of $250.[9] It was registered as Infosys Consultants
      Private Limited on 2 July 1981.[10] In 1983, it relocated to Bangalore,
      Karnataka. The company changed its name to Infosys Technologies Private
      Limited in April 1992 and to Infosys Technologies Limited when it became a
      public limited company in June 1992.[11] It was renamed Infosys Limited in
      June 2011.[12] An initial public offering (IPO) was floated in February
      1993 with an offer price of ₹95 (equivalent to ₹690 or US$8.20 in 2023)
      per share against a book value of ₹20 (equivalent to ₹150 or US$1.70 in
      2023) per share. The IPO was undersubscribed but it was "bailed out" by US
      investment bank Morgan Stanley, which picked up a 13% equity stake at the
      offer price.[13] Its shares were listed in June 1993 with trading opening
      at ₹145 (equivalent to ₹1,100 or US$13 in 2023) per share.[14] Infosys
      shares were listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in 1999 as American
      depositary receipts (ADR). It became the first Indian company to be listed
      on Nasdaq.[citation needed] The share price surged to ₹8,100 (equivalent
      to ₹35,000 or US$420 in 2023) by 1999, making it the costliest share on
      the market at the time. At that time, Infosys was among the 20 biggest
      companies by market capitalization on the Nasdaq.[13] The ADR listing was
      shifted from Nasdaq to NYSE Euronext to give European investors better
      access to the company's shares.[15] In July 2010, then-British Prime
      Minister David Cameron visited Infosys HQ in Bangalore and addressed
      Infosys employees.[16] Infosys, Bangalore In 2012, Infosys announced a new
      office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to serve Harley-Davidson.[17][18] Infosys
      hired 1,200 United States employees in 2011 and expanded the workforce by
      2,000 employees in 2012.[18] In April 2018, Infosys announced expansion in
      Indianapolis, Indiana. In July 2014, Infosys started a product subsidiary
      called EdgeVerve Systems, focusing on enterprise software products for
      business operations, customer service, procurement and commerce network
      domains.[19] In August 2015, assets from Finacle Global Banking Solutions
      were transferred from Infosys, thus becoming part of the product company
      EdgeVerve Systems' product portfolio.[20] Its annual revenue surpassed
      US$10 million in FY 1995, US$100 million in FY 1999, US$1 billion in FY
      2004, and US$10 billion in FY 2017. Its most up to date report, as of

    <h4>Settlement of tax fraud in the US</h4>
    <p>
      In December 2019, the Attorney General of California, Xavier Becerra
      announced an $800,000 settlement against Infosys and its BPM (business
      process management) subsidiary. Close to 500 Infosys employees were
      working in the state on Infosys-sponsored B-1 visas instead of H-1B visas
      between 2006 and 2017, as per an official post available on the website of
      State of California.[87][88] This misclassification resulted in Infosys
      avoiding California payroll taxes such as unemployment insurance,
      disability insurance, and employment training taxes.[89][90]
    </p>
    <h4>Accusation of visa fraud in the US</h4>
    <p>
      In 2011, Infosys was accused of committing visa fraud by using B-1
      (visitor) visas for work requiring H-1B (work) visas. The allegations were
      initially made by an American employee of Infosys in an internal
      complaint. He subsequently sued the company, claiming that he was harassed
      and sidelined after speaking out. Although that case was dismissed it,[91]
      along with another similar case,[92][93][94] brought the allegations to
      the notice of the US authorities – and the U.S. Department of Homeland
      Security and a federal grand jury started investigating.[95] In October
      2013, Infosys agreed to settle the civil suit with US authorities by
      paying US$34 million.[96] Infosys refused to admit guilt and stressed that
      it only agreed to pay the fine to avoid the nuisance of "prolonged
      litigation".[97] In its statement, the company said "As reflected in the
      settlement, Infosys denies and disputes any claims of systemic visa fraud,
      misuse of visas for competitive advantage, or immigration abuse. Those
      claims are assertions that remain unproven".[98]
    </p>
    <h4>Malfunctioning income tax, GST and MCA portal</h4>
    <p>
      From 2016 onwards, after Infosys took over the contract from Tata
      Consultancy Services stakeholders complained about malfunctioning and low
      performance of portals multiple times. The Income Tax portal went down on
      the due date of multiple tax periods and taxpayers ended up paying late
      fees and penalties, and the government allowed the extension of due dates
      because of this.[99][100][101][102] Chartered accountants and Company
      secretaries raised issues with MCA portal on due dates. Many companies
      became liable for additional fees and fines due to non-compliance. This
      issue is turning opposite to Ease of doing business initiatives of
      Government of India.[103][104][105] CAs and Tax professionals raised
      concerns about the flawed GST portal and their inability to rectify these
      issues.[106][107][108] Government faced severe criticism from CAs, CSs and
      other stakeholders for its continuous failure to take action against
      Infosys and alleged that public fund is being heavily mis-utilised.[109]
