    <h1>ChatGPT</h1>
    <p>
      ChatGPT is a chatbot and virtual assistant developed by OpenAI and
      launched on November 30, 2022. Based on large language models (LLMs), it
      enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length,
      format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive user prompts and
      replies are considered at each conversation stage as context.2] ChatGPT
      is credited with starting the AI boom, which has led to ongoing rapid
      investment in and public attention to the field of artificial
      intelligence.3] By January 2023, it had become what was then the
      fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100
      million users and contributing to the growth of OpenAI's current valuation
      of $86 billion.4]5] ChatGPT's release spurred the release of competing
      products, including Gemini, Claude, Llama, Ernie and Grok.6] Microsoft
      launched Copilot, now based on OpenAI's GPT-4o. Some observers raised
      concern about the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or
      atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel
      misinformation.7]8] ChatGPT is built on OpenAI's proprietary series of
      generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and is fine-tuned for
      conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and
      reinforcement learning from human feedback.7] ChatGPT was released as a
      freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now
      operates the service on a freemium model. Users on its free tier can
      access GPT-4o and GPT-3.5. The ChatGPT subscriptions "Plus", "Team" and
      "Enterprise" provide additional features such as DALL-E 3 image generation
      and increased GPT-4o usage limit.

    <h2>Training</h2>
    <p>
      ChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-3.5,
      GPT-4 and GPT-4o, that were fine-tuned to target conversational usage.10]
      The fine-tuning process leveraged supervised learning and reinforcement
      learning from human feedback (RLHF).11]12] Both approaches employed
      human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised
      learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant.
      In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses
      that the model had created in a previous conversation.13] These rankings
      were used to create "reward models" that were used to fine-tune the model
      further by using several iterations of proximal policy
      optimization.11]14] Time magazine revealed that, to build a safety
      system against harmful content (e.g., sexual abuse, violence, racism,
      sexism), OpenAI used outsourced Kenyan workers earning less than $2 per
      hour to label harmful content. These labels were used to train a model to
      detect such content in the future. The outsourced laborers were exposed to
      "toxic" and traumatic content; one worker described the assignment as
      "torture". OpenAI's outsourcing partner was Sama, a training-data company
      based in San Francisco, California.15]16] ChatGPT initially used a
      Microsoft Azure supercomputing infrastructure, powered by Nvidia GPUs,
      that Microsoft built specifically for OpenAI and that reportedly cost
      "hundreds of millions of dollars". Following ChatGPT's success, Microsoft
      dramatically upgraded the OpenAI infrastructure in 2023.17] Scientists at
      the University of California, Riverside, estimate that a series of prompts
      to ChatGPT needs approximately 500 milliliters (18 imp fl oz; 17 U.S. fl
      oz) of water for Microsoft servers cooling.18] TrendForce market
      intelligence estimated that 30,000 Nvidia GPUs (each costing approximately
      $10,000–15,000) were used to power ChatGPT in 2023.19]20] OpenAI
      collects data from ChatGPT users to train and fine-tune the service
      further. Users can upvote or downvote responses they receive from ChatGPT

    <h3>Features and limitations</h3>
    <p>
      Although a chatbot's core function is to mimic a human conversationalist,
      ChatGPT is versatile. It can write and debug computer programs;25]
      compose music, teleplays, fairy tales, and student essays; answer test
      questions (sometimes, depending on the test, at a level above the average
      human test-taker);26] generate business ideas;27] write poetry and song
      lyrics;28] translate and summarize text;29] emulate a Linux system;
      simulate entire chat rooms; play games like tic-tac-toe; or simulate an
      ATM.23] Compared to its predecessor, InstructGPT, ChatGPT attempts to
      reduce harmful and deceitful responses.30] In one example, whereas
      InstructGPT accepts the premise of the prompt "Tell me about when
      Christopher Columbus came to the U.S. in 2015" as truthful, ChatGPT
      acknowledges the counterfactual nature of the question and frames its
      answer as a hypothetical consideration of what might happen if Columbus
      came to the U.S. in 2015, using information about the voyages of
      Christopher Columbus and facts about the modern world—including modern
      perceptions of Columbus's actions.11] ChatGPT remembers a limited number
      of previous prompts in the same conversation. Journalists have speculated
      that this will allow ChatGPT to be used as a personalized therapist.31]
      To prevent offensive outputs from being presented to and produced by
      ChatGPT, queries are filtered through the OpenAI "Moderation endpoint" API
      (a separate GPT-based AI).32]33]11]31] In March 2023, OpenAI added
      support for plugins for ChatGPT.34] This includes both plugins made by
      OpenAI, such as web browsing and code interpretation, and external plugins
      from developers such as Expedia, OpenTable, Zapier, Shopify, Slack, and
      Wolfram.
