    <h1>Microsoft</h1>
    <p>
      Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational corporation and
      technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington.[2] Microsoft's
      best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems,
      the Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, and the Edge web
      browser. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles
      and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers.
      Microsoft ranked No. 14 in the 2022 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest
      United States corporations by total revenue;[3] and it was the world's
      largest software maker by revenue in 2022 according to Forbes Global 2000.
      It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology
      companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Apple,
      and Meta (parent company of Facebook). Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates
      and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters
      for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating
      system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. The
      company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent rise in its
      share price created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000
      millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has
      increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made
      several corporate acquisitions, the largest being the acquisition of
      Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in October 2023,[4] followed by its
      acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016,[5] and its
      acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.[6] As of
      2015, Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating
      system market and the office software suite market, although it has lost
      the majority of the overall operating system market to Android.[7] The
      company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise
      software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and servers, including
      Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN),
      mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software
      development (Visual Studio). Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000
      and later envisioned a "devices and services" strategy.[8] This unfolded
      with Microsoft acquiring Danger Inc. in 2008,[9] entering the personal
      computer production market for the first time in June 2012 with the launch
      of the Microsoft Surface line of tablet computers, and later forming
      Microsoft Mobile through the acquisition of Nokia's devices and services
      division. Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has
      scaled back on hardware and instead focused on cloud computing, a move
      that helped the company's shares reach their highest value since December
      1999.[10][11] Under Nadella's direction, the company has also heavily
      expanded its gaming business to support the Xbox brand, establishing the
      Microsoft Gaming division in 2022, dedicated to operating Xbox in addition
      to its three subsidiaries (publishers). Microsoft Gaming is the
      third-largest gaming company in the world by revenue as of 2024.[12] In
      2018, Microsoft became the most valuable publicly traded company in the
      world, a position it has repeatedly traded with Apple in the years
      since.[13] In April 2019, Microsoft reached a trillion-dollar market cap,
      becoming the third U.S. public company to be valued at over $1 trillion
      after Apple and Amazon, respectively. As of 2024, Microsoft has the
      third-highest global brand valuation. Microsoft has been criticized for
      its monopolistic practices and the company's software has been criticized
      for problems with ease of use, robustness, and security.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      1972–1985: Founding An Altair 8800 computer (left) with the popular Model
      33 ASR Teletype as terminal, paper tape reader, and paper tape punch Paul
      Allen and Bill Gates on October 19, 1981, after signing a pivotal contract
      with IBM[14]: 228  Bill Gates and Paul Allen's Original Business Cards
      located in the Microsoft Visitor Center. Childhood friends Bill Gates and
      Paul Allen sought to make a business using their skills in computer
      programming.[15] In 1972, they founded Traf-O-Data, which sold a
      rudimentary computer to track and analyze automobile traffic data. Gates
      enrolled at Harvard University while Allen pursued a degree in computer
      science at Washington State University, though he later dropped out to
      work at Honeywell.[16] The January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics
      featured Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems's (MITS) Altair 8800
      microcomputer,[17] which inspired Allen to suggest that they could program
      a BASIC interpreter for the device. Gates called MITS and claimed that he
      had a working interpreter, and MITS requested a demonstration. Allen
      worked on a simulator for the Altair while Gates developed the
      interpreter, and it worked flawlessly when they demonstrated it to MITS in
      March 1975 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. MITS agreed to distribute it,
      marketing it as Altair BASIC.[14]: 108, 112–114  Gates and Allen
      established Microsoft on April 4, 1975, with Gates as CEO,[18] and Allen
      suggested the name "Micro-Soft," short for micro-computer
      software.[19][20] In August 1977, the company formed an agreement with
      ASCII Magazine in Japan, resulting in its first international office of
      ASCII Microsoft.[21] Microsoft moved its headquarters to Bellevue,
      Washington, in January 1979.[18]
