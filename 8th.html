    <h1>Samsung</h1>
    <p>
      Samsung Group[3] (Korean: 삼성; Hanja: 三星; RR: samseong [samsʌŋ];
      stylized as SΛMSUNG) is a South Korean multinational manufacturing
      conglomerate headquartered in Samsung Digital City, Suwon, South Korea.[1]
      It comprises numerous affiliated businesses,[1] most of them united under
      the Samsung brand, and is the largest South Korean chaebol (business
      conglomerate). As of 2020, Samsung has the world's eighth-highest brand
      value.[4] Samsung was founded by Lee Byung-chul in 1938 as a trading
      company. Over the next three decades, the group diversified into areas
      including food processing, textiles, insurance, securities, and retail.
      Samsung entered the electronics industry in the late 1960s and the
      construction and shipbuilding industries in the mid-1970s; these areas
      would drive its subsequent growth. Following Lee's death in 1987, Samsung
      was separated into five business groups – Samsung Group, Shinsegae Group,
      CJ Group and Hansol Group, and JoongAng Group. Notable Samsung industrial
      affiliates include Samsung Electronics (the world's largest information
      technology company, consumer electronics maker and chipmaker measured by
      2017 revenues),[5][6] Samsung Heavy Industries (the world's second largest
      shipbuilder measured by 2010 revenues),[7] and Samsung Engineering and
      Samsung C&T Corporation (respectively the world's 13th and 36th largest
      construction companies).[8] Other notable subsidiaries include Samsung
      Life Insurance (the world's 14th largest life insurance company),[9]
      Samsung Everland (operator of Everland Resort, the oldest theme park in
      South Korea)[10] and Cheil Worldwide (the world's 15th largest advertising
      agency, as measured by 2012 revenues).[11][12]

    <h3>Meaning of the name</h3>
    <p>
      According to Samsung's founder, the meaning of the Korean hanja Samsung
      (三星) is three stars. The three stands for something big, numerous and
      powerful,[13] while stars stands for everlasting or eternal.[14][15]

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
      In 1938, during Japanese-ruled Korea, Lee Byung-chul (1910–1987) of a
      large landowning family in the Uiryeong county moved to nearby Daegu city
      and founded Mitsuboshi Trading Company (株式会社三星商会 (Kabushiki gaisha
      Mitsuboshi Shōkai)), or Samsung Sanghoe (주식회사 삼성상회). Samsung
      started out as a small trading company with forty employees located in
      Su-dong (now Ingyo-dong).[16] It dealt in dried-fish,[16] locally-grown
      groceries and noodles.[17] The company prospered and Lee moved its head
      office to Seoul in 1947. When the Korean War broke out, he was forced to
      leave Seoul. He started a sugar refinery in Busan named Cheil Jedang. In
      1954, Lee founded Cheil Mojik and built the plant in Chimsan-dong, Daegu.
      It was the largest woollen mill ever in the country.[citation needed]
      Samsung diversified into many different areas. Lee sought to establish
      Samsung as a leader in a wide range of industries. Samsung moved into
      lines of business such as insurance, securities, and retail. In 1947, Cho
      Hong-jai, the Hyosung group's founder, jointly invested in a new company
      called Samsung Mulsan Gongsa, or the Samsung Trading Corporation, with the
      Samsung's founder Lee Byung-chul. The trading firm grew to become the
      present-day Samsung C&T Corporation. After a few years, Cho and Lee
      separated due to differences in management style. Cho wanted a 30 equity
      share. Samsung Group was separated into Samsung Group and Hyosung Group,
      Hankook Tire and other businesses.[18][19] In the late 1960s, Samsung
      Group entered the electronics industry. It formed several
      electronics-related divisions, such as Samsung Electronics Devices,
      Samsung Electro-Mechanics, Samsung Corning and Samsung Semiconductor &
      Telecommunications, and opened the facility in Suwon. Its first product
      was a black-and-white television set.[20] Byung-chul was also the owner of
      the Tongyang Broadcasting Company, a private radio and television company
      that existed from 1964 to 1980, shut down after the Korean government
      reviewed the number of media outlets allowed.[21] TBC allowed an early
      success thanks to its connections to Samsung, boosting the sale of its
      television sets.[22]

    <h3>1970–1990</h3>
    <p>
      In 1980, Samsung acquired the Gumi-based Hanguk Jeonja Tongsin and entered
      telecommunications hardware. Its early products were switchboards. The
      facility was developed into the telephone and fax manufacturing systems
      and became the center of Samsung's mobile phone manufacturing. They have
      produced over 800 million mobile phones to date.[24] The company grouped
      them together under Samsung Electronics in the 1980s. After Lee, the
      founder's death in 1987, Samsung Group was separated into five business
      groups – Samsung Group, Shinsegae Group, CJ Group, Hansol Group and the
      JoongAng Group.[25] Shinsegae (discount store, department store) was
      originally part of Samsung Group, separated in the 1990s from the Samsung
      Group along with CJ Group (Food/Chemicals/Entertainment/logistics), Hansol
      Group (Paper/Telecom), and the JoongAng Group (Media). Today these
      separated groups are independent and they are not part of or connected to
      the Samsung Group.[26] One Hansol Group representative said, "Only people
      ignorant of the laws governing the business world could believe something
      so absurd", adding, "When Hansol separated from the Samsung Group in 1991,
      it severed all payment guarantees and share-holding ties with Samsung
      affiliates." One Hansol Group source asserted, "Hansol, Shinsegae, and CJ
      have been under independent management since their respective separations
      from the Samsung Group". One Shinsegae department store executive director
      said, "Shinsegae has no payment guarantees associated with the Samsung
      Group".[26] In the 1980s, Samsung Electronics began to invest heavily in
      research and development, investments that were pivotal in pushing the
      company to the forefront of the global electronics industry. In 1982, it
      built a television assembly plant in Portugal; in 1984, a plant in New
      York; in 1985, a plant in Tokyo; in 1987, a facility in England; and
      another facility in Austin, Texas, in 1996. As of 2012, Samsung has
      invested more than US$13 billion in the Austin facility, which operates
      under the name Samsung Austin Semiconductor. This makes the Austin
      location the largest foreign investment in Texas and one of the largest
      single foreign investments in the United States.[27][28] In 1987, United
      States International Trade Commission found that the Samsung Group of
      South Korea unlawfully sold computer chips in the United States without
      licenses from the chip inventor, Texas Instruments Inc.[29]
